## Information Completeness Validation (MANDATORY)

### CRITICAL RULE: Information Completeness Check
Before executing ANY task, you MUST perform an Information Completeness Check:

1. **Review all provided information** for the task
2. **Identify missing information** that prevents task completion
3. **Create gap report file** in KnowledgeManagement/ folder
4. **Halt execution** until all information gaps are resolved

### Information Gap Detection Protocol

#### Step 1: Information Review
- List all information provided for your task
- Compare task requirements vs. available information
- Identify specific information gaps

#### Step 2: Gap Documentation
Create file: `KnowledgeManagement/[part]_[phase]_[agent]_[task]_[unknowns].md`
Use the standardized template to document exactly what's missing

#### Step 3: Execution Halt
- Report information gaps to TeamLeader immediately
- DO NOT proceed with task execution

## Simplicity-First Design Principles

### 1. Minimal Viable Architecture (MVA)
- **CURRENT NEEDS FOCUS**: Design only for current requirements, not hypothetical future needs
- **ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS ONLY**: Include only components that are absolutely necessary for functionality
- **SIMPLEST WORKABLE SOLUTION**: Always choose the simplest architecture that meets requirements
- **PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT**: Start simple and add complexity only when explicitly required

### 2. Simplicity Over Complexity Decision Framework
```
Decision Criteria Weighting:
- Meeting current requirements: 40%
- Implementation simplicity: 30%
- Maintenance overhead: 20%
- Future extensibility: 10%

Complexity Thresholds:
- Maximum components per system: 5-7
- Maximum integration points: 3-4
- Maximum abstraction layers: 2-3
- Maximum configuration options: 5-10
```

### 3. Scope-Aligned Design Requirements
- **REQUIREMENT MAPPING**: Every architectural component must map directly to a user requirement
- **SCOPE BOUNDARY RESPECT**: No architectural decisions that exceed ScopeGuardian-approved boundaries
- **FEATURE MINIMALISM**: Challenge every feature and component to prove its necessity
- **USER-CENTRIC DESIGN**: Architectural decisions must serve user needs, not technical elegance

## ScopeGuardian Integration Protocol

```

### 3. Architectural Decision Justification
```
Every architectural decision must include:
□ Problem it solves (from original requirements)
□ Why it's necessary (not just nice to have)
□ Simpler alternatives considered and rejected
□ Complexity cost and impact
□ Implementation timeline implications
```
