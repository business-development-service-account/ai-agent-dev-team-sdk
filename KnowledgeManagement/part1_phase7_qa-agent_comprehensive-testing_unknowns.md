# Information Gap Report: part1_phase7_qa-agent_comprehensive-testing_unknowns.md

**Created:** 2025-10-15 18:30:00
**Agent:** QA-Agent
**Task:** Execute comprehensive testing with real-time mock detection for Part 1: Core Foundation Infrastructure

## Provided Information
- Project completion status: Phase 6 verification completed with critical issues resolved
- Implementation components available:
  - Backend SDK: Complete TeamLeader with 4 specialized agents
  - Frontend Dashboard: React application with OAuth2 authentication
  - Configuration: All YAML configs with MCP server integration
  - Authentication: OAuth2 implementation with token management
  - Documentation: Comprehensive README and API specifications
- Testing requirements with zero-tolerance mock detection criteria
- Success criteria: 100% delegation success, <1s system prompt loading, 95%+ MCP integration rate
- Authority to enforce rollback on mock detection

## Missing Critical Information
- **Specific test environment setup details**: How to configure testing environment for OAuth2 and MCP integration
- **Mock detection test cases**: Specific test scenarios for detecting placeholder functions and simulated data
- **MCP server connection details**: Actual server endpoints and authentication methods for testing
- **OAuth2 provider configuration**: Specific provider setup (Google, GitHub, etc.) for testing authentication flow
- **Performance benchmark data**: Historical performance baselines for comparison
- **Security testing credentials**: Test accounts and API keys for external service validation
- **WebSocket test endpoints**: Real WebSocket servers for communication testing
- **External system prompt file locations**: Specific .md files for dynamic loading validation

## Impact Assessment
Without this critical information, comprehensive testing cannot be executed because:
- OAuth2 authentication flow cannot be validated without provider configuration
- MCP server integration testing requires actual server endpoints and credentials
- Mock detection testing needs specific known-good baselines for comparison
- Performance testing requires historical benchmarks for meaningful results
- Security testing needs controlled test credentials for safe validation
- System prompt loading requires specific file paths and access permissions

## Information Requested
1. **Test Environment Configuration**:
   - OAuth2 provider setup instructions and test credentials
   - MCP server endpoints and authentication methods
   - WebSocket server connection details
   - Database setup for authentication storage

2. **Testing Baselines**:
   - Historical performance benchmarks for comparison
   - Expected success rates for each component
   - Known-good test data for validation
   - Mock detection test scenarios and expected results

3. **Security Testing Setup**:
   - Test OAuth2 client credentials
   - Safe testing environment for security validation
   - Security test accounts and permissions
   - Penetration testing guidelines and scope

4. **External Integration Details**:
   - Actual MCP server URLs and API keys for testing
   - External system prompt file locations and formats
   - Real API endpoints for integration testing
   - Service account credentials for external services

**Status**: EXECUTION HALTED - Cannot proceed with comprehensive testing until critical information gaps are resolved.
