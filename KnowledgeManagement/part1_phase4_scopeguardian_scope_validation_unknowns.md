# Information Gap Report: part1_phase4_scopeguardian_scope_validation_unknowns.md

**Created:** 2025-10-15 15:45:00
**Agent:** ScopeGuardian
**Task:** Validate context package and implementation plan scope compliance for Part 1: Core Foundation Infrastructure

## Provided Information
- Summary of available context package files (REQUIREMENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, API_SPECS.md, DATABASE_SCHEMA.md, DEPENDENCIES.md, CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md, CONTEXT_ANOMALIES.md)
- Security assessment results (92/100 security rating, critical gate PASS)
- Original Part 1 specifications (25/100 complexity points, 3 months timeline, 4 sub-agents, MCP integration)
- Success criteria (100% delegation success, <1s prompt loading, 95%+ MCP success rate)
- Security requirements (Enterprise-grade with OAuth2/OpenID Connect)

## Missing Critical Information
- **ACTUAL CONTEXT PACKAGE FILES**: All referenced files (REQUIREMENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, API_SPECS.md, DATABASE_SCHEMA.md, DEPENDENCIES.md, CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md) are not provided for analysis
- **CONTEXT_ANOMALIES.MD CONTENT**: Gap analysis showing 95% confidence referenced but actual content not accessible
- **PHASE 1 RESEARCH FINDINGS**: No access to comprehensive research that informed the context package
- **PROJECT_MANIFEST.YAML**: No access to the project blueprint and decomposition from Phase 0
- **ORIGINAL ITDS-001 INQUIRY**: No access to the locked original user inquiry document
- **PHASE 2 ARCHITECTURE PLAN**: No access to the implementation plan that informed the context package preparation
- **KNOWLEDGE BASE CONTEXT**: No access to historical scope validation patterns and risk assessment approaches
- **TEAMLEADER DELEGATION CONTEXT**: No specific delegation instructions from TeamLeader for Phase 4 validation

## Impact Assessment
**Scope Validation Impossible**: Without access to actual context package files, I cannot perform the required scope boundary validation, requirements compliance check, or architecture compliance assessment.

**No Traceability Available**: Without access to original inquiry and research findings, I cannot validate the traceability matrix from original requirements to implementation specifications.

**Risk Assessment Incomplete**: Without context anomalies content and historical patterns, I cannot perform comprehensive risk assessment or apply knowledge-based validation approaches.

**Authority Cannot Be Exercised**: As ScopeGuardian, I cannot exercise veto authority or approve scope compliance without complete information for validation.

## Information Requested
- Provide all actual context package files for detailed analysis
- Provide access to original ITDS-001 locked inquiry document
- Provide Phase 1 research findings that informed the context package
- Provide project_manifest.yaml and Phase 2 architecture plan
- Provide KnowledgeManagerAgent context package for historical scope validation patterns
- Provide specific TeamLeader delegation instructions for Phase 4 validation
- Provide access to CONTEXT_ANOMALIES.MD content for gap analysis review
