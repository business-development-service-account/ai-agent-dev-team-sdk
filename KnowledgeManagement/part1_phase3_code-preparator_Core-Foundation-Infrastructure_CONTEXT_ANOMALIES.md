## Recommendations for Coding Agents

### Implementation Priorities

Based on the comprehensive context analysis, the following implementation priorities are recommended:

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)
1. **TeamLeader Foundation** - Implement core orchestration logic
2. **Rules Engine** - Implement ten-phase process with validation
3. **System Prompt Management** - Dynamic loading with hot-reload
4. **Basic WebSocket Communication** - Real-time messaging foundation

#### Phase 2: Agent Development (Weeks 3-4)
1. **Base Agent Class** - Claude SDK integration foundation
2. **ResearchAgent** - Perplexity MCP integration
3. **CodeBaseAnalyzer** - Serena MCP integration
4. **FrontEndCoder/BackEndCoder** - Specialized implementations

#### Phase 3: Integration and Security (Weeks 5-6)
1. **MCP Integration Framework** - Universal client with fallback
2. **Security Framework** - OAuth2 + RBAC implementation
3. **Database Layer** - Models, repositories, migrations
4. **Monitoring and Logging** - Observability foundation

### Key Implementation Considerations

#### 1. Security-First Development
- Implement authentication and authorization from the beginning
- Use input validation and sanitization for all external inputs
- Follow OWASP security best practices
- Implement comprehensive audit logging

#### 2. Performance Optimization
- Use async/await patterns consistently
- Implement connection pooling for databases and external services
- Use caching for frequently accessed data (system prompts, etc.)
- Monitor and optimize resource usage

#### 3. Error Handling and Resilience
- Implement comprehensive error handling with proper classification
- Use retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Provide meaningful error messages and recovery options

#### 4. Testing and Quality Assurance
- Achieve >90% test coverage for all critical components
- Implement integration tests for all external integrations
- Use mock detection to prevent placeholder data in production
- Perform load testing for performance validation

#### 5. Documentation and Maintainability
- Follow established code patterns and conventions
- Provide comprehensive inline documentation
- Use type hints for better code documentation
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
