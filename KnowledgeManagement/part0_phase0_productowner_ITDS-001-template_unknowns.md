# Information Gap Report: part0_phase0_productowner_ITDS-001-template_unknowns.md

**Created:** 2025-01-15 12:45:00
**Agent:** ProductOwnerAgent
**Task:** Create ITDS-001 template capturing original user inquiry with comprehensive research findings

## Provided Information
- Original user request: Develop AI Agent Dev Team SDK based on Chinese interface image
- Comprehensive research analysis from 100+ sources (Phase0_research-agent_project-initialization_comprehensive-analysis.md)
- Market size: $5.25B (2024) â†’ $52.62B (2030), CAGR 51.3%
- Technical architecture: Hierarchical coordination, temporal consistency, federated TeamLeader
- Competitive analysis: CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, AWS Agent Squad
- Implementation roadmap: 4 phases over 12 months
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Key differentiators: Programmatic rules engine, validation gates, contract-based interaction

## Missing Critical Information
1. **ITDS-001 Template Structure**: Standardized template format and required sections
2. **Project Identification**: Formal project ID, version number, classification level
3. **Stakeholder Information**: Project sponsor, approval authorities, organizational context
4. **Financial Information**: Budget constraints, funding sources, cost estimates, ROI requirements
5. **Timeline Specifications**: Hard deadlines, milestone dates, release schedules, time constraints
6. **Compliance Requirements**: Regulatory standards, security certifications, industry-specific requirements
7. **Resource Constraints**: Team composition, skill requirements, infrastructure limitations
8. **Quality Standards**: Specific KPIs, success metrics, acceptance criteria definitions
9. **Risk Thresholds**: Acceptable risk levels, contingency requirements, governance framework
10. **Integration Requirements**: Existing system dependencies, technical constraints, compatibility needs

## Impact Assessment
Without the ITDS-001 template structure and missing organizational context information, I cannot create a complete, authoritative project specification document that would serve as the binding source for the entire development lifecycle. The missing information prevents:
- Formal project authorization and governance
- Proper stakeholder alignment and approval processes
- Accurate resource planning and allocation
- Compliance with organizational standards and procedures
- Establishment of binding success criteria and validation metrics

## Information Requested
1. **ITDS-001 Template**: Provide the standard organizational template format
2. **Project Context**: Organizational structure, approval workflows, governance requirements
3. **Financial Framework**: Budget constraints, funding mechanisms, cost approval processes
4. **Timeline Constraints**: Project deadlines, milestone requirements, release schedules
5. **Compliance Framework**: Required standards, certifications, regulatory requirements
6. **Resource Availability**: Team structure, skill requirements, infrastructure constraints
7. **Quality Standards**: Organization-specific KPIs, success metrics, acceptance criteria

**Status**: HALTED - Cannot proceed with ITDS-001 creation until template and organizational context are provided
**Next Steps**: TeamLeader must provide ITDS-001 template and missing organizational information before ProductOwnerAgent can proceed with formal project specification creation
