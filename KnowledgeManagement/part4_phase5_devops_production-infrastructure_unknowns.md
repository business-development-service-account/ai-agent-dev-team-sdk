# Information Gap Report: part4_phase5_devops_production-infrastructure_unknowns.md

**Created:** 2025-10-15 14:00:00
**Agent:** DevOpsAgent
**Task:** Implement complete DevOps infrastructure for AI Agent Dev Team SDK production deployment

## Provided Information
- **Project Structure**: AI Agent Dev Team SDK with 4-part development lifecycle
- **Current Phase**: Part 4 - Production Readiness & Ecosystem (Months 10-12)
- **Core Technology Stack**: Python-based Claude Agents SDK, WebSocket communication, PostgreSQL database
- **Infrastructure Requirements**: AWS EKS, RDS PostgreSQL, ECR, CloudFront, monitoring with CloudWatch/Prometheus/Grafana
- **Security Requirements**: SSL/TLS, secret management, vulnerability scanning, network security
- **Deployment Strategy**: Blue-green deployment with zero downtime and automated rollback
- **Compliance Standards**: SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR ready with audit trails
- **Domain**: aiagentdevteam.com with CloudFront CDN
- **Performance Targets**: 1000+ concurrent agents, <2 second response times, 99.9% uptime

## Missing Critical Information

### 1. AWS Account and Authentication Details
- AWS account ID and region specifications
- IAM roles and permissions structure
- AWS credentials management approach
- VPC networking requirements (CIDR blocks, subnets)
- Existing AWS infrastructure to integrate with

### 2. Application Architecture Specifications
- Exact application port configurations
- Service discovery and load balancing requirements
- Database connection details and credentials management
- Environment-specific configuration values
- Container resource requirements (CPU, memory, storage)

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
- GitHub repository details and branch strategy
- Build and deployment trigger conditions
- Testing requirements and quality gates
- Artifact storage and versioning strategy
- Rollback procedures and success criteria

### 4. Monitoring and Alerting Thresholds
- Specific metrics to monitor (application performance, system health)
- Alert threshold values and escalation procedures
- Log retention policies and compliance requirements
- Dashboard requirements for different stakeholder groups
- Integration with existing monitoring systems

### 5. Security and Compliance Details
- SSL certificate management approach
- Secret rotation policies and procedures
- Network security group rules and firewall configurations
- Backup and disaster recovery requirements
- Audit logging specifications and retention periods

### 6. Cost Management and Budgeting
- Infrastructure cost estimates and budget constraints
- Resource tagging strategy for cost allocation
- Auto-scaling policies to control costs
- Reserved instances or savings plans strategy

## Impact Assessment
Each missing piece prevents proper infrastructure implementation:
- Without AWS account details: Cannot provision any cloud resources
- Without application specs: Cannot configure proper networking and security
- Without CI/CD details: Cannot implement automated deployment pipeline
- Without monitoring thresholds: Cannot set up proper observability
- Without security specifics: Cannot implement enterprise-grade security controls
- Without cost constraints: Cannot optimize infrastructure for budget compliance

## Information Requested
Please provide the following critical information to proceed with DevOps implementation:

1. **AWS Infrastructure Details**:
   - AWS account ID, preferred region, and existing VPC information
   - IAM role requirements and security policies
   - Network architecture preferences (public/private subnets, NAT gateways)

2. **Application Configuration**:
   - Service port mappings and internal communication protocols
   - Database connection strings and credential management approach
   - Environment variables and configuration management strategy
   - Container resource requirements and scaling parameters

3. **Deployment Pipeline Requirements**:
   - GitHub repository structure and branching strategy
   - Build, test, and deployment automation requirements
   - Quality gates and approval workflows
   - Rollback triggers and recovery procedures

4. **Monitoring and Alerting Specifications**:
   - Key performance indicators and threshold values
   - Alert routing and escalation procedures
   - Compliance monitoring and reporting requirements
   - Dashboard access control and customization needs

5. **Security Implementation Details**:
   - SSL certificate procurement and management
   - Secret management tool preferences (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
   - Network security requirements and compliance controls
   - Backup strategy and disaster recovery procedures

6. **Budget and Cost Constraints**:
   - Monthly infrastructure budget limits
   - Cost optimization requirements and reporting
   - Resource allocation tagging strategy
   - Auto-scaling cost control mechanisms

**Status**: DEVOPS_IMPLEMENTATION_HALTED - Waiting for critical information resolution

## UPDATE: Information Gathered from Existing Project Analysis

**Additional Information Discovered:**

### Application Configuration (from team_leader.yaml)

- **API Service**: localhost:8000 (from API specs)
- **Logging**: JSON format, 100MB max file size, 5 backup count
- **Security**: Currently authentication disabled for development, rate limiting 100 req/min

### Database Configuration (from database schema)
- **Database Name**: "ai_agent_sdk"
- **Engine**: PostgreSQL 15+
- **Connection Pooling**: 10-100 connections, 30s timeout
- **Backup Requirements**: Daily full backup, 30-day retention, geographic replication

### Application Structure (from pyproject.toml)
- **Python Version**: >=3.11
- **Dependencies**: anthropic, websockets, dynaconf, asyncpg, redis, etc.
