## Document Status

**Status:** READY FOR CODING AGENTS  
**Validation:** All dependencies reviewed and approved  
**Completeness:** 100% - All required dependencies specified with versions and configurations  
**Traceability:** All dependencies traceable to requirements and architecture decisions  

**Next Steps:** Coding agents should use this dependency specification to set up development environments, configure external service integrations, and implement the dependency management strategy.
