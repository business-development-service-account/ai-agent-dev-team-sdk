## Missing Critical Information

### 1. Cloud Infrastructure Provider and Environment
- **Missing**: Specific cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, or on-premises)
- **Missing**: Cloud region and availability zone preferences
- **Missing**: Existing cloud infrastructure details and constraints
- **Missing**: Budget constraints for infrastructure costs
- **Missing**: Scaling requirements and auto-scaling policies

### 2. External Service Configuration
- **Missing**: Actual API keys and credentials for:
  - Anthropic Claude SDK
  - Perplexity MCP server
  - Serena MCP server
  - OAuth2 providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft)
- **Missing**: Service endpoint URLs and configurations
- **Missing**: Rate limiting and quota details for external services

### 3. Domain and SSL Configuration
- **Missing**: Domain name for production deployment
- **Missing**: SSL certificate management preferences
- **Missing**: DNS configuration requirements
- **Missing**: CDN requirements and preferences

### 4. Database Configuration Details
- **Missing**: Production database connection details
- **Missing**: Database backup and retention policies
- **Missing**: High availability and disaster recovery requirements
- **Missing**: Database performance tuning requirements

### 5. Monitoring and Alerting Configuration
- **Missing**: Preferred monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana, CloudWatch, DataDog, etc.)
- **Missing**: Alert notification preferences (email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.)
- **Missing**: Specific metrics and KPIs to monitor
- **Missing**: Log retention policies and compliance requirements

### 6. Security and Compliance Requirements
- **Missing**: Specific security compliance standards (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, etc.)
- **Missing**: Security scanning tools preferences
- **Missing**: Vulnerability management procedures
- **Missing**: Access control and user management requirements

### 7. Development Environment Preferences
- **Missing**: Development tools preferences (IDEs, terminals, etc.)
- **Missing**: Local development setup requirements
- **Missing**: Developer onboarding procedures
- **Missing**: Code review and approval processes

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact Issues:**
- Cloud provider selection affects all infrastructure decisions and cost estimates
- Missing API keys prevent actual service integration and testing
- Security compliance requirements determine monitoring and logging configurations

**Medium Impact Issues:**
- Domain and SSL configuration affects production deployment planning
- Database configuration details affect backup and HA strategies
- Monitoring preferences affect observability implementation

**Low Impact Issues:**
- Development environment preferences affect local setup documentation
- Alerting preferences can be configured after initial deployment

## Information Requested

**Critical Decisions Needed:**
1. **Cloud Infrastructure**: Which cloud provider should be used? What are the budget constraints?
2. **External Services**: What are the actual API endpoints and authentication mechanisms for MCP servers?
3. **Domain Configuration**: What is the production domain name and SSL certificate preferences?
4. **Compliance Requirements**: What specific security and compliance standards must be met?

**Configuration Details Needed:**
1. **Database**: Production database specifications, backup requirements, and HA needs
2. **Monitoring**: Preferred monitoring stack and alert notification channels
3. **Security**: Specific security tools, scanning requirements, and compliance frameworks
4. **Development**: Local development environment preferences and onboarding procedures

**Implementation Preferences:**
1. **Deployment Strategy**: Blue-green deployment, canary releases, or rolling updates?
2. **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, CloudFormation, or Pulumi for IaC?
3. **Container Registry**: Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google Container Registry, or Azure Container Registry?
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Specific branching strategy and approval workflows?

## Next Steps

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Confirm cloud provider selection and budget constraints
2. Obtain API keys and service configurations for external MCP servers
3. Define production domain name and SSL certificate requirements
4. Specify security compliance requirements and monitoring preferences

**Conditional Implementation:**
- Proceed with creating Docker and local development infrastructure (can be implemented without cloud decisions)
- Create GitHub Actions workflow templates (can be customized later)
- Implement monitoring and logging infrastructure (can use default configurations initially)
- Set up database migration and backup scripts (can use local configurations initially)
