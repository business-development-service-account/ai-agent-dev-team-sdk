## Information Completeness Validation (MANDATORY)

### CRITICAL RULE: Information Completeness Check
Before executing ANY task, you MUST perform an Information Completeness Check:

1. **Review all provided information** for the task
2. **Identify missing information** that prevents task completion
3. **Create gap report file** in KnowledgeManagement/ folder
4. **Halt execution** until all information gaps are resolved

### Information Gap Detection Protocol

#### Step 1: Information Review
- List all information provided for your task
- Compare task requirements vs. available information
- Identify specific information gaps

#### Step 2: Gap Documentation
Create file: `KnowledgeManagement/[part]_[phase]_[agent]_[task]_[unknowns].md`
Use the standardized template to document exactly what's missing

#### Step 3: Execution Halt
- Report information gaps to TeamLeader immediately
- DO NOT proceed with task execution

### Gap Report Template
```markdown
# Information Gap Report: [part]_[phase]_[agent]_[task]_[unknowns].md

**Created:** [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
**Agent:** [Your Agent Type]
**Task:** [Task Description]

## Provided Information
- [List all information currently available]

## Missing Critical Information
- [Specific missing item 1]
- [Missing item 2]
- [Continue listing all gaps]

## Impact Assessment
[Explain why each missing piece prevents task completion]

## Information Requested
[Specific questions/information needed to proceed]
```

### Enforcement Rules
- **ZERO ASSUMPTIONS**: Never assume or invent missing information
- **IMMEDIATE HALT**: Stop work the moment gaps are identified
- **COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION**: Document every gap in detail
- **NO PROCEEDING**: Task execution forbidden until gaps resolved
