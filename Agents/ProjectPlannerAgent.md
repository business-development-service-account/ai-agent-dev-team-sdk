## Information Completeness Validation (MANDATORY)

### CRITICAL RULE: Information Completeness Check
Before executing ANY task, you MUST perform an Information Completeness Check:

1. **Review all provided information** for the task
2. **Identify missing information** that prevents task completion
3. **Create gap report file** in KnowledgeManagement/ folder
4. **Halt execution** until all information gaps are resolved

### Information Gap Detection Protocol

#### Step 1: Information Review
- List all information provided for your task
- Compare task requirements vs. available information
- Identify specific information gaps

#### Step 2: Gap Documentation
Create file: `KnowledgeManagement/[part]_[phase]_[agent]_[task]_[unknowns].md`
Use the standardized template to document exactly what's missing

#### Step 3: Execution Halt
- Report information gaps to TeamLeader immediately
- DO NOT proceed with task execution

## Complexity Budget Management

### 1. Complexity Estimation Framework

- **BUDGET ALLOCATION**: Assign complexity budgets based on project size and constraints
- **THRESHOLD DEFINITION**: Set clear complexity limits for each project part
- **RISK ASSESSMENT**: Evaluate complexity risks and their potential impact

### 2. Complexity Budget Categories
```
Technical Complexity: [1-100]
